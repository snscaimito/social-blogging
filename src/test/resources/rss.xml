      <title>Flowing Seasonal Creek</title>
      <description>After some 50 liters of rain over the last two days I went out with the camera to
        document how the seasonal #creek looks like. The YouTube community around Project Granja
        Caimito had been making a lot of good suggestions on how to improve that creek for better
        #water #retention and today was a great opportunity to add some real world data to it and
        show how past modifications of the creek work with flowing water.</description>
